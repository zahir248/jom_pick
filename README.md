1. Introduction

The JomPick System is designed to significantly improve item pick up management in university and public use . Its primary purpose is to facilitate the efficient distribution of client's documents, letters, and parcels, as well as managing the proper disposal of unnecessary items. This system will make it easier for clients, including students, staff, and others, to always be aware and receive timely alerts about the availability of their goods awaiting collection.

2. Problem Statement

- Lack of Real-time Visibility: We struggle with providing customers with real-time visibility into the status of their pickups. This lack of transparency leads to customer dissatisfaction and support inquiries.
- Inaccurate Pickup Documentation: We often encounter issues with inaccurate or missing documentation related to pickups, which can result in disputes, billing errors, and operational setbacks.
- Inadequate Reporting and Analytics: We struggle to gather and analyze data related to pickup operations, hindering our ability to make data-driven decisions and improvements.
- Inefficient Pickup Scheduling: We face challenges in efficiently scheduling and managing pickups for various services. The current system relies heavily on manual processes, leading to delays and operational 
  inefficiencies.

3. Objective

- Develop a customer portal or mobile app that provides real-time updates on pickup status, including estimated client arrival times, and confirmation notifications upon successful pickup.
- Implement a digital document management system that allows staff to capture and upload necessary documentation such as signatures and photos during pickups.This system should integrate with the central database 
  to ensure accuracy and accessibility.
- Develop a robust reporting and analytics module that provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), such as pickup success rates, turnaround times, and resource utilization. This system should 
  support customizable reports and dashboards for informed decision-making.
- Implement an automated pickup scheduling system that integrates with GPS technology to optimize routes, considers real-time factors like traffic, and allows customers to schedule pickups conveniently through a 
  user-friendly web or mobile application.

4. Target User

- Students and Staff of University: Students and staff may occasionally need pickups for various purposes, including moving equipment or materials. They should have access to the system to request pickups and 
  track their progress.
- Logistics and Operations Team of University: The logistics and operations team at UTeM would be primary users of the system. They would use it to schedule, manage, and optimize pickups of various items within 
  the university, such as mail, supplies, and equipment.
- Facility Management Staff: This group includes personnel responsible for waste collection, maintenance, and fix bug services. They can use the system to efficiently schedule pickups and maintenance tasks.

  are met for pickups.
