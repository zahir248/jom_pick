The JomPick System is designed to significantly improve item pick up
management in university and public use . Its primary purpose is to facilitate the
efficient distribution of client's documents, letters, and parcels, as well as managing
the proper disposal of unnecessary items. This system will make it easier for clients,
including students, staff, and others, to always be aware and receive timely alerts
about the availability of their goods awaiting collection.
